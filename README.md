# D-TOF Imaging System
#### A 'Direct Time of Flight' (D-TOF) Imaging System developed using the AD-96TOF1-EBZ Evaluation Kit and a Zybo Z7 FPGA board.

## Setup Instructions
1. Connect the AD-96TOF1-EBZ Evaluation Kit to the Raspberry Pi via an FFC cable and power it on BEFORE powering up the Pi.  
3. Connect the Zybo Z7 FPGA board to the Raspberry Pi via a USB-to-micro-USB connector.
4. Connect the Zybo Z7 FPGA board to an external 1920x1080 monitor.
5. Power on the Raspberry Pi and Zybo Z7 FPGA boards.
6. Execute the ~/rpi_interfacer/src/main.py script stored on the Raspberry Pi.
